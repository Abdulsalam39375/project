<h1>Director Message</h1>
<p>  
I am proud to say that the University of Sindh has given a lead by establishing Institute
of Information and Communication Technology with vision that IICT 
will change the education, economics, planning strategies trends and even recreation horizons, and no efforts can be initiated in ignorance of ICT. The institute is producing manpower in Information Technology, Telecommunication, Software Engineering and Electronics with learning outcomes necessary to design hardware and software systems, apply the technologies effectively for diverse environment, adopt analytical and logical approach and foster independent judgment and ability to work cooperatively. Institute is also producing Master and Ph.D level scholars in respective ICT disciplines since its inception. The highly qualified faculty of IICT is always in continuous quest to keep the pace with rapid development in IT and the world market demand by introducing new schemes of studies. The modern infrastructure of excellent learning including state-of-art computers, electronic, and communication laboratories connected to information cyberspace via PERN link, and multimedia facilities extend the institute as a beacon for information technology education. I expect that the young talent will avail opportunity of threefold advantages: high academic quality, excellent facilities and market demand learning skills, and earn laurels for themselves, and wisdom for Institute of Information and Communication Technology University of Sindh.
